                * Test [daily builds](https://builder.blender.org/) to verify if the issue is already fixed.
                * Test [previous versions](https://download.blender.org/release/) to find an older working version.
                * For feature requests, feedback, questions or build issues, see [communication channels](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/communication/user_feedback/).
                * Security vulnerabilities should be [reported privately](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/bug_reports/vulnerability_reports/).
