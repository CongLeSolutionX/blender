# Vulkan Profiles

Vulkan profiles are JSON formatted documents describing the feature set
Blender uses. We will also collect some platforms we want to support.
This way when our requirements change we can check if there is a drop of
platform support.

The file `VP_APP_blender.json` describes the requirements and optionals
that Blender uses. Other files are a set of platforms we check when changing
the requirements.

These files can be generated by the `vulkaninfo` application that is part of
many drivers and the vulkan-sdk.
